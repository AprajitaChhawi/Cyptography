#x2=7mod33
#prime factorising 33=3^1*11^1
#so the two equations will be
#x2=7mod3 which can be simplified to
#x2=1mod3---------------------------------(1)
#the second equation will be
#x2=7mod11--------------------------------(2)
#now we can see that the seconf equation has no solution
#so this quadratic congruence has no solution
